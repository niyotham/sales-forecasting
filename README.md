## Pharmaceutical sales prediction for multiple-stores



The finance team at Rossman wants to forecast sales in all thier stores across several cities six weeks 
ahead of time. This project is all about building and serving an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts in the finance team.

## Goal
 Build and serve an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts in the finance team.
 
 ## Exploratory Data Analysis
Data exploratory analysis is done after combining the two datasets train and test and is found in eda file [notebooks/notebooks/eda_store.ipynb](https://github.com/niyotham/sales-forecasting/blob/main/notebooks/eda_store.ipynb)

logging.info('I told you so')
```
## Prediction of store sales
- Preprocessing
- Building models with sklearn pipelines
- Choose a loss function
- Post Prediction analysis
- Serialize models
- Building model with deep learning
- Using MLFlow to serve the prediction
## Serving predictions on a web interface
